= Maintainer's Guide

toc::[]

This guide is intended for contributors tagged as **reviewers on a pull request** or have **triage**, **write**, or **maintainer** roles on the {repo-title} repo.

== Workflow

We use the https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow[github flow] for managing this repository.
At a glance, this means:

- a **main** branch.
  This branch MUST be releasable at all times.
  New branches should be created from this branch.
  Pull requests made to this branch should be linked to one or more issues.

== Issue triage process

Issues are tracked using the GitHub issue tracker. See https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart[Quickstart for GitHub Issues].

Issue triaging responsibilities include:

- **Labeling Issue**. Labels are used to identify a category, in order to narrow the scope and subject matter of an open issue. See https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart#adding-labels[Adding labels].
- **Resolving duplicates**. Newly reported duplicate issues can be resolved using the `duplicate` label.
- **Adding to a milestone**. Issues can be included as part of an existing milestone. See https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart#adding-milestones[Adding milestones].
- **Adding to a project**. Issues can be included as part of an existing project. See https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart#adding-the-issue-to-a-project[Adding the issue to a project].
- **Communicating**. Contributors are encouraged to engage conversation in the form of comments on an issue. See https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart#communicating[Communicating].
